This means that the results obtained for the TDC in a per-residue calculation will probably be different from the TDC of a per-wise calculation with the same residues. This is because the per-residue energy contribution is calculated taking into account the environment that surrounds each residue, so the sum of their contributions will be exactly the maximum contribution per selected residues. On the other hand, in the per-wise calculation, the TDC will be equal to the sum of each residue contribution, the difference being that the contribution of each residue is obtained from the contributions of the selected pairs and not with all the environment that surrounds it.

By default, gmx_MMPBSA calculates an average, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean for all the generated data sets, but it does not support custom analyses. The API reads an _GMXMMPBSA_info file, from which it will determine what kind of calculation was performed, then automatically parse the output files and load the data into arrays. Warning The topology files you used in the gmx_MMPBSA calculation must also be available in the location specified in the _ GMXMMPBSA_info file. Using the API \u00b6 We have derived a new API to reorganize the data so that it is arranged more hierarchically. This makes easier to transform the data into graphs in the gmx_MMPBSA_ana . **The original and the current API only differ in the name of the callable function, the disposition of the data in Per-wise decomposition analysis and in the new 'delta' key. The function load_gmxmmpbsa_info takes the name of a gmx_MMPBSA info file (typically _GMXMMPBSA_info ) and returns a populated mmpbsa_data instance with all the parsed data. An example code snippet that creates a mmpbsa_data instance from the information in _ GMXMMPBSA_info is shown below.

Otherwise, all data arrays will be array.array instances with the \u2019d\u2019 data type specifier (for a double precision float). The data is organized in an mmpbsa_data instance in the following manner: mmpbsa_data_instance [ 'calc_key' ][ 'system_component' ][ 'energy_term' ] In this example, calc_key is a dict key that is paired to another dict ( mmpbsa_data_instance is the first-level dict , in this case) (Table 2).

This is useful if, for instance, you run two gmx_MMPBSA calculations, and you use -prefix for the second simulation. Assuming that is _GMXMMPBSA2_ for the second gmx_MMPBSA calculation, the following pseudo-code will generate an mmpbsa_data instance with all of the data in concatenated arrays. The pseudo-code assumes GMXMMPBSA.API was imported as demonstrated below. data = gmxMMPBSAapi . load_gmxmmpbsa_info ( \"_GMXMMPBSA_info\" ) data += gmxMMPBSAapi . load_gmxmmpbsa_info ( \"_GMXMMPBSA2_info\" ) Example API Usage \u00b6 In many cases, the autocorrelation function of the energy can aid in the analysis of MM/PBSA data, since it provides a way of determining the statistical independence of your data points. For example, 1000 correlated snapshots provide less information, and therefore less statistical certainty, than 1000 uncorrelated snapshots. The standard error of the mean calculation performed by gmx_MMPBSA assumes a completely uncorrelated set of snapshots, which means that it is a lower bound of the true standard error of the mean, and a plot of the autocorrelation function may help determine the actual value. The example program below will calculate the autocorrelation function of the total energy (complex only for both the normal and alanine mutant systems) from a GB calculation and plot the resulting code using matplotlib. import os import sys # append AMBERHOME/bin to sys.path sys . path . append ( os . path . join ( os . getenv ( 'AMBERHOME' ), 'bin' )) # Now import the MMPBSA API from GMXMMPBSA import API as gmxMMPBSAapi import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np data = gmxMMPBSAapi . load_gmxmmpbsa_info ( '_GMXMMPBSA_info' ) total = data [ 'gb' ][ 'complex' ][ 'TOTAL' ] . copy () data = gmxMMPBSAapi . load_gmxmmpbsa_info ( '_GMXMMPBSA_info' ) total_mut = data . mutant [ 'gb' ][ 'complex' ][ 'TOTAL' ] . copy () # Create a second copy of the data set.

The key sequence is similar to the sequence for the normal data described above, where decomp is followed by the solvent model ( GB or PB ), followed by the species ( complex , receptor , or ligand ) (additionally, we include delta key), followed by the decomposition components (total, backbone, or sidechain), followed by the residue number (and residue pair for pairwise decomposition), finally followed by the contribution ( internal , van der Waals , electrostatics , etc.) The available keys are shown in Figure 1 (and each key is described afterwards).

Based on MMPBSA.py (version 16.0) and AmberTools20 Running gmx_MMPBSA \u00b6 Tip Since version 1.4.0 we have fixed the gmx_MMPBSA inconsistencies when using MPI . We currently recommend the use of MPI since the computation time decreases considerably. Parallel (MPI) version gmx_MMPBSA as MMPBSA.py uses the MPI only to perform the calculations during the dynamics, the rest of the process (Generation/conversion of Amber topologies, mutation, division of the trajectories, etc) occurs in a single thread (See Figure 1 1 for better reference). This means that it is not necessary to install any program (AmberTools or GROMACS) with MPI , which can be used in any circumstance, and the time required to process the data prior to the calculation depends on the system and will be the same for both versions ( Serial and MPI ). Note Note that gmx_MMPBSA processes, converts, or builds topologies from GROMACS files, so it takes slightly longer than MMPBSA.py at the same stage of the process. However, this is not really significant. Remember Make sure that you install the OpenMPI library sudo apt install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev openssh-client A usage example is shown below: Local mpirun -np 2 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.xtc HPC #!/bin/sh #PBS -N nmode #PBS -o nmode.out #PBS -e nmode.err #PBS -m abe #PBS -M email@domain.edu #PBS -q brute #PBS -l nodes=1:surg:ppn=3 #PBS -l pmem=1450mb or > 5gb for nmode calculation cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR mpirun -np 3 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.xtc > progress.log Danger Unfortunately, when gmx_MMPBSA is run with MPI , GROMACS's gmx_mpi is incompatible. This is probably because of gmx_mpi conflicts with mpirun. In any case, this is not a problem since gmx works correctly and gmx_mpi only parallels mdrun , the rest of the GROMACS tools work in a single thread. See this issue to see the output. Warning The nmode calculations require a considerable amount of RAM. Consider that the total amount of RAM will be: RAM total = RAM 1_frame * NUM of Threads If it consumes all the RAM of the system it can cause crashes, instability or system shutdown! Note At a certain level, running RISM in parallel may actually hurt performance, since previous solutions are used as an initial guess for the next frame, hastening convergence. Running in parallel loses this advantage. Also, due to the overhead involved in which each thread is required to load every topology file when calculating energies, parallel scaling will begin to fall off as the number of threads reaches the number of frames. Serial version This version is installed via pip as described above. AMBERHOME variable must be set, or it will quit with an error.

But, what does that mean? Basically, gmx_MMPBSA brings in all the MMPBSA.py functionalities to GROMACS users. MMPBSA.py is an excellent and well-known tool to perform calculations with the PB and GB models in AMBER (February/2021 more than 1200 citations). On the other hand, there are tools like g_mmpbsa that are well known in the GROMACS community (February/2021 more than 1100 citations). Interestingly, MMPBSA.py is more robust and was published first, however, both have a similar number of citations. This is probably due to the fact that the GROMACS (Open source and free) community is large, while AMBER has the restriction of a paid license, or a small community with free academic license. The use of MMPBSA.py for GROMACS users requires enormous effort to successfully complete the process. In that regard, we have decided to make our experience in this process available to the community. We have not limited ourselves only to the extent of utility itself, but added additional value. We have designed a tool that allows to perform a number of calculations in an effortless way with a graphical tool incorporated, which we believe has great potential for the analysis of the results obtained. We also have incorporated some functionalities that aren't present in MMPBSA.py and made others more accessible to the beginner user in Amber. gmx_MMPBSA general workflow \u00b6 gmx_MMPBSA can be divided into 3 parts as shown in figure 1. IN the first part, Preparation , the topologies and trajectories are generated, among other elements depending on the calculations, such as the mutants for the alanine or glycine scanning or the interaction residues during decomposition analysis. In the second part, Calculation , the binding free energies and/or entropies are estimated using the selected models. Finally, in the last step Analysis , the results can be analyzed by using the graphical user interface gmx_MMPBSA_ana . Figure 1 . gmx_MMPBSA general workflow Required input files \u00b6 Currently, gmx_MMPBSA supports two families of force fields: Amber and CHARMM. Although these force fileds are quite similar, the generation of topologies differs. When Amber force filed was used to prepare the system(s), the topologies compatible with AMBER package can be generated from either GROMACS topologies or structures. Meanwhile, when CHARMM force field is used, AMBER's topologies are generated from GROMACS topologies exclusively. (Table 1). Table 1: Required input files for every force field Force field Structure Index Trajectory Topology Reference Structure Small Molecule Mol2 AMBER tpr, gro, pdb ndx xtc, trr, pdb, gro Optional Optional Only if not top CHARMM tpr, gro, pdb ndx xtc, trr, pdb, gro Always Optional No Topology preparation \u00b6 In this section, we will go in detail about each file and what they are used for. GROMACS files MD Structure+mass(db) (tpr, pdb, gro): This file is used to generate the structure in pdb format of the complex with editconf . We recommend using the *.tpr (production *.tpr) format. Index (ndx) This the file that contains the index of each element contained in the *.tpr file, organized as groups. This file is required for the definition of the groups corresponding to the receptor and the ligand. Trajectory (xtc, trr, pdb, gro) Trajectory files. Topology (top) This file contains all the parameters corresponding to the force field selected during the system setup. When using a GROMACS topology, parmed is used for converting the topologies. This method can be useful when studying a complex system with many elements. However, its main strength (flexibility) is its main weakness. GROMACS can parameterize your system differently than AMBER, so the conversion can result in a topology with very dissimilar parameters that AMBER does not understand. If you use amber, you can consider whether to use this method or not. However, when using CHARMM (any version) force field, the topology is always required. Reference Structure It corresponds to a file in *.pdb format that must contain a complete structure. That is, the user must make sure that this structure contains the same number of atoms and residues as the complex that he initially defined, the correct residue numbering, as well as its chain ID. This structure is optional, but we recommend using it since it should guarantee a smooth processing of the files in gmx_MMPBSA . Essentially, the objective is to be able to correctly assign the mentioned parameters since internally gmx_MMPBSA handles sensitive information, for example: when it extracts the receptor and the ligand from the complex structure, the mutation in the alanine scan, etc. Small molecule parameters (mol2) This file contains a ligand parameterization with antechamber that is not found in the selected force field (Amber family). It is only necessary to define it when studying a system that contains this type of ligand, and a topology has not been defined. This is used to build amber topology from structure using tleap . Here are the steps that gmx_MMPBSA follows to generate the topologies: Specific steps for the topology are highlighted like this Generates a new index and registers the groups defined by the user Generates the pdb of the complex, receptor, and ligand Topologies are cleaned (remove water and ions) The structures or parameters for the receptor and the ligand are generated if it is a ST approximation. If Alanine scanning: the mutant of the complex, and the mutant receptor or ligand are generated If decomposition: interaction residues are extracted The complex is mapped. Registers the continuity of the receptor (example: Metalloprotein structure files are generally structured as follows: Receptor protein + Ligand + Receptor Ions) The PBRadii is assigned Topologies are converted with parmed or generated with tleap The following figure shows the process to generate AMBER topologies depending on the force field.

GROMACS files MD Structure+mass(db) (tpr, pdb, gro): This file is used to generate the structure in pdb format of the complex with editconf . We recommend using the *.tpr (production *.tpr) format. Index (ndx) This the file that contains the index of each element contained in the *.tpr file, organized as groups. This file is required for the definition of the groups corresponding to the receptor and the ligand. Trajectory (xtc, trr, pdb, gro) Trajectory files. Topology (top) This file contains all the parameters corresponding to the force field selected during the system setup. When using a GROMACS topology, parmed is used for converting the topologies. This method can be useful when studying a complex system with many elements. However, its main strength (flexibility) is its main weakness. GROMACS can parameterize your system differently than AMBER, so the conversion can result in a topology with very dissimilar parameters that AMBER does not understand. If you use amber, you can consider whether to use this method or not. However, when using CHARMM (any version) force field, the topology is always required. Reference Structure It corresponds to a file in *.pdb format that must contain a complete structure. That is, the user must make sure that this structure contains the same number of atoms and residues as the complex that he initially defined, the correct residue numbering, as well as its chain ID. This structure is optional, but we recommend using it since it should guarantee a smooth processing of the files in gmx_MMPBSA . Essentially, the objective is to be able to correctly assign the mentioned parameters since internally gmx_MMPBSA handles sensitive information, for example: when it extracts the receptor and the ligand from the complex structure, the mutation in the alanine scan, etc. Small molecule parameters (mol2) This file contains a ligand parameterization with antechamber that is not found in the selected force field (Amber family). It is only necessary to define it when studying a system that contains this type of ligand, and a topology has not been defined. This is used to build amber topology from structure using tleap . Here are the steps that gmx_MMPBSA follows to generate the topologies: Specific steps for the topology are highlighted like this Generates a new index and registers the groups defined by the user Generates the pdb of the complex, receptor, and ligand Topologies are cleaned (remove water and ions) The structures or parameters for the receptor and the ligand are generated if it is a ST approximation. If Alanine scanning: the mutant of the complex, and the mutant receptor or ligand are generated If decomposition: interaction residues are extracted The complex is mapped. Registers the continuity of the receptor (example: Metalloprotein structure files are generally structured as follows: Receptor protein + Ligand + Receptor Ions) The PBRadii is assigned Topologies are converted with parmed or generated with tleap The following figure shows the process to generate AMBER topologies depending on the force field. Figure 1 . Topology generation workflow for Single Trajectory Approximation","title":"Topology preparation"},{"location":"input_file/","text":"The input file \u00b6 Description \u00b6 As gmx_MMPBSA is based on MMPBSA.py , it uses an input file containing all the specification for the MM/PB(GB) SA calculation. The input file is designed to be as syntactically similar to other programs in Amber as possible. The input file has the same namelist structure as both sander and pmemd. The allowed namelists are &general , &gb , &pb , &rism , &alanine_scanning , &nmode , and &decomp . The input variables recognized in each namelist are described below, but those in &general are typically variables that apply to all aspects of the calculation or parameters required for build amber topologies from GROMACS files. The &gb namelist is unique to Generalized Born calculations, &pb is unique to Poisson Boltzmann calculations, &rism is unique to 3D-RISM calculations, &alanine_scanning is unique to alanine scanning calculations, &nmode is unique to the normal mode calculations used to approximate vibrational entropies, and &decomp is unique to the decomposition scheme. All of the input variables are described below according to their respective namelists. Integers and floating point variables should be typed as-is while strings should be put in either single- or double-quotes. All variables should be set with variable = value and separated by commas. See several examples below. As you will see, several calculations can be performed in the same run ( i.e. &gb and &pb , &gb and &alanine_scanning , &pb and &decomp , etc). Variables will usually be matched to the minimum number of characters required to uniquely identify that variable within that namelist. Variables require at least 4 characters to be matched unless that variable name has fewer than 4 characters (in which case the whole variable name is required). For example, \"star\" in &general will match startframe . However, \"stare\" and \"sta\" will match nothing. &general namelist variables \u00b6 assign_chainID (Default = 0) Defines the chains ID assignment mode. It is ignored when defining a reference structure (recommended) . If assign_chainID = 1 , gmx_MMPBSA check if the structure has no chains ID and it is assigned according to the structure 1 . If assign_chainID = 2 , gmx_MMPBSA assign the chains ID, exist or not, according to the structure 1 (can generate inconsistencies). If a *.gro file was used for complex structure ( -cs flag) and not reference structure was provided, gmx_MMPBSA assume assign_chainID = 1 . New in v1.2.0 debug_printlevel gmx_MMPBSA prints errors by raising exceptions, and not catching fatal errors. If debug_printlevel is set to 0, then detailed tracebacks (effectively the call stack showing exactly where in the program the error occurred) is suppressed, so only the error message is printed. If debug_printlevel is set to 1 or higher, all tracebacks are printed, which aids in debugging of issues. (Default = 0) (Advanced Option) Changed in v1.2.0: Now gmx_MMPBSA shows the command-line used to build AMBER topologies when debug_printlevel = 1 or higher startframe (Default = 1) The frame from which to begin extracting snapshots from the full, concatenated trajectory comprised of every trajectory file placed on the command-line. This is always the first frame read. endframe (Default = 9999999) The frame from which to stop extracting snapshots from the full, concatenated trajectory comprised of every trajectory file supplied on the command-line. qh_entropy (Default = 0) It specifies whether to perform a quasi-harmonic entropy (QH) approximation with ptraj or not. 0: Don\u2019t 1: perform QH New in v1.4.2: Equivalent to (Deprecate) entropy = 1 Deprecated in v1.4.2: It will be removed in next version (v1.5.0). Use qh_entropy or interaction_entropy instead entropy (default = 0) It specifies whether to perform a quasi-harmonic entropy (QH) approximation with ptraj or the Interaction Entropy (IE) approximation. The allowed values are: 0: Don\u2019t 1: perform QH 2: perform IE Deprecated since v1.4.2: Divided in qh_entropy and interaction_entropy Changed in v1.0.0: Include Interaction Entropy approximation interaction_entropy (default = 0) It specifies whether to perform the Interaction Entropy (IE) approximation. 0: Don\u2019t 1: perform IE Keep in mind The Interaction Entropy method is dependent on the number of frames and the simulated time. Additionally, the results may vary depending on the system flexibility or whether constraints were used or not in the MD simulation. Please, consult this paper for further details New in v1.4.2: Equivalent to (Deprecate) entropy = 2 ie_segment (Default = 25) Representative segment (in %), starting from the last frame, for the calculation of the Interaction Entropy, e.g. : ie_segment = 25 means that the last quartile of the total number of frames ( (endframe-startframe)/interval ) will be used to calculate the average Interaction Entropy. New in v1.4.2 Deprecated in v1.4.2: It will be removed in next version (v1.5.0). Use ie_segment instead entropy_seg (Default = 25) Representative segment (in %), starting from the endframe , for the calculation of the Interaction Entropy, e.g. : entropy_seg = 25 means that the last quartile of the total number of frames ( (endframe-startframe)/interval ) will be used to calculate the average Interaction Entropy. (Only if entropy = 2 ) Deprecated since v1.4.2: Replaced by ie_segment New in v1.0.0 Deprecated in v1.4.0: It will be removed in next version. Use temperature instead entropy_temp (Default = 298.15) Specify the temperature to calculate the entropy term \u2212T\u0394S (Only if entropy = 2). Avoid inconsistencies with defined internal temperature (298.15 K) when nmode is used. exp_ki (Default = 0.0) Specify the experimental Ki in nM for correlations analysis. If not defined or exp_ki = 0 then this system will be omitted in the correlation analysis New in v1.4.0 gmx_path Define an additional path to search for GROMACS executables. This path takes precedence over the path defined in the PATH variable. In these path the following executables will be searched: gmx , gmx_mpi , gmx_d , gmx_mpi_d (GROMACS > 5.x.x), make_ndx , editconf and trjconv (GROMACS 4.x.x) New in v1.1.1 interval (Default = 1) The offset from which to choose frames from each trajectory file. For example, an interval of 2 will pull every 2 nd frame beginning at startframe and ending less than or equal to endframe. netcdf (Default = 0) Specifies whether or not to use NetCDF trajectories internally rather than writing temporary ASCII trajectory files. For very large trajectories, this could offer significant speedups, and requires less temporary space. However, this option is incompatible with alanine scanning. 0: Do NOT use temporary NetCDF trajectories 1: Use temporary NetCDF trajectories overwrite_data (Default = 0) Defines whether the gmx_MMPBSA data will be overwritten. gmx_MMPBSA detects if the gmxMMPBSA data files exist before copying them. This option allows the user to control the copy process and prevents the system from being overloaded by copying files unnecessarily. 0: don't 1: overwrite gxmMMPBSA data if exist Tip We recommend activating this option with each new release because there may be changes and/or corrections in the gmxMMPBSA data files. New in v1.3.1 PBRadii (Default = 3) PBRadii to build amber topology files: 1: bondi, recommended when igb = 7 2: mbondi, recommended when igb = 1 3: mbondi2, recommended when igb = 2 or 5 4: mbondi3, recommended when igb = 8 forcefields (Default = \"oldff/leaprc.ff99SB,leaprc.gaff\") Comma-separated list of force fields used to build Amber topologies. This variable is more flexible than the existing ones ( protein_forcefield and ligand_forcefield ).

Please refer to the section \"How gmx_MMPBSA works\" This notation is simpler since these parameter files are generally the same for all systems sys_name (Default = None) (Optional) Define the System Name. This is useful when trying to analyze several systems at the same time or calculating the correlation between the predicted and the experimental energies. If the name is not defined, one will be assigned when loading it in gmx_MMPBSA_ana according to the order in this is done.

Avoid inconsistencies with defined internal temperature (298.15 K) when nmode or qh are used. Keep in mind Note that the nmode as qh model to calculate the entropy term are parameterized and will only work at 298.15 K New in v1.4.0: Replace entropy_temp use_sander (Default = 0) use sander for energy calculations, even when mmpbsa_py_energy will suffice 0: Use mmpbsa_py_energy when possible 1: Always use sander Note Sander is always used when building the Amber topology from a Gromacs topology. This, because the conversion can generate parameters that are not recognized by mmpbsa_py_energy verbose (Default = 1) The variable that specifies how much output is printed in the output file. There are three allowed values: 0: print difference terms 1: print all complex, receptor, and ligand terms 2: also print bonded terms if one trajectory is used &gb namelist variables \u00b6 ifqnt (Default = 0) Specifies whether a part of the system is treated with quantum mechanics. 1: Use QM/MM 0: Potential function is strictly classical Note This functionality requires sander igb (Default = 5) Generalized Born method to use (seeSection 4). Allowed values are 1, 2, 5, 7 and 8 Note All models are now available with both mmpbsa_py_energy and sander qm_residues Complex residues to treat with quantum mechanics. All residues treated with quantum mechanics in the complex must be treated with quantum mechanics in the receptor or ligand to obtain meaningful results. This notation is the same used for print_res variable Notation: [ CHAIN /( RESNUM or RESNUM-RESNUM ) ] Treat with quantum mechanics residues individual or ranges. This notation also supports insertion codes, in which case you must define them individually Example qm_residues=\"A/1,3-10,15,100\" This treat with quantum mechanic Chain A residues 1, 3 through 10, 15, and 100 from the complex topology file and the corresponding residues in either the ligand and/or receptor topology files. Suppost that we can have the following sequence: A:LEU:5, A:GLY:6:A, A:THR:6:B, A:SER:6:C A:ASP:6D, A:ILE:7 Right notation Ranges selection qm_residues=\"A/5-7 Will treat with quantum mechanic all mentioned residues because all residues with insertion code are contained in the range Individual selection qm_residues=\"A/5,6:B,6:C,7 Will treat with quantum mechanic all mentioned residues except the residues A:6:A and A:6:D Multiple chain selection qm_residues=\"A/5-10,100 B/34,56 Will treat with quantum mechanic residues 3 through 10, 100 from chain A and residues 34 and 56 from Chain B. Wrong notation qm_residues=\"A/5-6B,6D-7 Will end in error. intdiel (Default = 1.0) Define Internal dielectric constant without use external *.mdin file qm_theory Which semi-empirical Hamiltonian should be used for the quantum calculation.

See the description of the molsurf action command in cpptraj . &pb namelist variables \u00b6 inp (Default = 2) Option to select different methods to compute non-polar solvation free energy. 0: No non-polar solvation free energy is computed 1: The total non-polar solvation free energy is modeled as a single term linearly proportional to the solvent accessible surface area, as in the PARSE parameter set, that is, if INP = 1, USE_SAV must be equal to 0. 2: The total non-polar solvation free energy is modeled as two terms: the cavity term and the dispersion term. The dispersion term is computed with a surface-based integration method closely related to the PCM solvent for quantum chemical programs. Under this framework, the cavity term is still computed as a term linearly proportional to the molecular solvent-accessible-surface area (SASA) or the molecular volume enclosed by SASA. cavity_offset (Default = -0.5692) Offset value used to correct non-polar free energy contribution.

It is converted to mM for PBSA and kept as M for APBS . linit (Default = 1000) Maximum number of iterations of the linear Poisson Boltzmann equation to try prbrad (Default = 1.4) Solvent probe radius in Angstroms. Allowed values are 1.4 and 1.6 radiopt (Default = 1) The option to set up atomic radii according to: 0: the prmtop, or 1: pre-computed values Warning radiopt=0 is recommended which means using radii from the prmtop file for both the PB calculation and for the NP. Check this thread and See Amber manual for more complete description. sander_apbs (Default = 0) Option to use APBS for PB calculation instead of the built-in PBSA solver. This will work only through the iAPBS interface built into sander.APBS .

Allowed values are: \"ALA\" or \"A\" for Alanine scanning and \"GLY\" or \"G\" for Glycine scanning. Changed in v1.3.0: Change mol (receptor or ligand) by mutant aminoacid (ALA or GLY) mutant_res (Default = None. Most be defined) Define the specific residue that is going to be mutated. Use the following format CHAIN:RESNUM (eg: 'A:350') or CHAIN:RESNUM:INSERTION_CODE if applicable (eg: \"A:27:B\"). Important Only one residue for mutation is supported! We recommend using the reference structure (-cr) to ensure the perfect match between the selected residue in the defined structure or topology This option allow gmx_MMPBSA to do the mutation. This way the user does not have to provide the mutant topology Changed in v1.4.0: Allow mutation in antibodies since it support insertion code notation cas_intdiel (Default = 0) The dielectric constant ( intdiel (GB)/ indi (PB)) will be modified depending on the nature of the residue to be mutated. 0: Don\u2019t 1: Adaptative intdiel assignation Important Works with the GB and PB calculations It is ignored when intdiel (GB)/ indi (PB) has been explicitly defined, that is, it is ignored if intdiel != 1.0 / indi != 1.0 (default values) Dielectric constant values has been assigned according to Yan et al., 2017 New in v1.4.2 intdiel_nonpolar (Default = 1) Define the intdiel (GB)/ indi (PB) value for nonpolar residues ( PHE , TRP , VAL , ILE , LEU , MET , PRO , CYX , ALA , GLY , PRO ) New in v1.4.2 intdiel_polar (Default = 3) Define the intdiel (GB)/ indi (PB) value for polar residues ( TYR , SER , THR , CYM , CYS , HIE , HID , ASN , GLN , ASH , GLH , LYN ) New in v1.4.2 intdiel_positive (Default = 5) Define the intdiel (GB)/ indi (PB) value for positive charged residues ( LYS , ARG , HIP ) New in v1.4.2 intdiel_negative (Default = 5) Define the intdiel (GB)/ indi (PB) value for negative charged residues ( GLU , ASP ) New in v1.4.2 &nmode namelist variables \u00b6 dielc (Default = 1.0) Distance-dependent dielectric constant drms (Default = 0.001) Convergence criteria for minimized energy gradient. maxcyc (Default = 10000) Maximum number of minimization cycles to use per snapshot in sander. nminterval 2 (Default = 1) Offset from which to choose frames to perform nmode calculations on nmendframe 2 (Default = 1000000) Frame number to stop performing nmode calculations on nmode_igb (Default = 1) Value for Generalized Born model to be used in calculations. Options are: 0: Vacuum 1: HCT GB model nmode_istrng (Default = 0.0) Ionic strength to use in nmode calculations. Units are Molarity. Non-zero values are ignored if nmode_igb is 0 above. nmstartframe 2 Frame number to begin performing nmode calculations on &decomp namelist variables \u00b6 csv_format (Default = 1 [CSV-formatted output file]) Print the decomposition output in a Comma-Separated-Variable (CSV) file. CSV files open natively in most spreadsheets. * If set to 1, this variable will cause the data to be written out in a CSV file, and standard error of the mean will be calculated and included for all data. * If set to 0, the standard, ASCII format will be used for the output file. dec_verbose (Default = 0) Set the level of output to print in the decomp_output file. 0: DELTA energy, total contribution only 1: DELTA energy, total, sidechain, and backbone contributions 2: Complex, Receptor, Ligand, and DELTA energies, total contribution only 3: Complex, Receptor, Ligand, and DELTA energies, total, sidechain, and backbone contributions Note If the values 0 or 2 are chosen, only the Total contributions are required, so only those will be printed to the mdout files to cut down on the size of the mdout files and the time required to parse them. idecomp Energy decomposition scheme to use: 1: Per-residue decomp with 1-4 terms added to internal potential terms 2: Per-residue decomp with 1-4 EEL added to EEL and 1-4 VDW added to VDW potential terms. 3: Pairwise decomp with 1-4 terms added to internal potential terms 4: Pairwise decomp with 1-4 EEL added to EEL and 1-4 VDW added to VDW potential terms Warning No default. This must be specified!. print_res (Default = \"within 6\") Select residues from the complex to print. The default selection should be sufficient in most cases, however we have added several additional notations By Distance Notation: [ within distance ] within corresponds to the keyword and distance to the maximum distance criterion in Angstroms necessary to select the residues from both the receptor and the ligand Example print_res=\"within 6\" Will print all residues within 6 Angstroms between receptor and ligand including both. By distance with exclusion Notation: [ within distance not ( receptor or ligand ) ] within corresponds to the keyword and distance to the maximum distance criterion in Angstroms necessary to select the residues from both the receptor and the ligand omitting the selected component ones Example print_res=\"within 6 not lig\" Will print all residues within 6 Angstroms between receptor and ligand omitting the ligand ones. Amino acid selection Notation: [ CHAIN /( RESNUM or RESNUM-RESNUM ) ] Print residues individual or ranges. This notation also supports insertion codes, in which case you must define them individually Example print_res=\"A/1,3-10,15,100\" This will print Chain A residues 1, 3 through 10, 15, and 100 from the complex topology file and the corresponding residues in either the ligand and/or receptor topology files. Suppost that we can have the following sequence: A:LEU:5, A:GLY:6:A, A:THR:6:B, A:SER:6:C A:ASP:6D, A:ILE:7 Supported notation Ranges selection print_res=\"A/5-7 Will print all mentioned residues because all residues with insertion code are contained in the range Individual selection print_res=\"A/5,6:B,6:C,7 Will print all mentioned residues except the residues A:6:A and A:6:D Multiple chain selection print_res=\"A/5-10,100 B/34,56 Will print residues 3 through 10, 100 from chain A and residues 34 and 56 from Chain B. Wrong notation print_res=\"A/5-6B,6D-7 Will end in error. All Notation: all will print all residues. This option is often not recommended since most residues contribution is zero and it is just going to be a waste of time and computational resources. Danger Using idecomp=3 or 4 (pairwise) with a very large number of printed residues and a large number of frames can quickly create very, very large temporary mdout files. Large print selections also demand a large amount of memory to parse the mdout files and write decomposition output file (~500 MB for just 250 residues, since that\u2019s 62500 pairs!) It is not unusual for the output file to take a significant amount of time to print if you have a lot of data. This is most applicable to pairwise decomp, since the amount of data scales as O(N 2 ). Important We recommend using the reference structure (-cr) to ensure the perfect match between the selected residue in the defined structure or topology Changed in v1.4.0: Improve residue selection &rism namelist variables \u00b6 Warning 3D-RISM calculations are performed with the rism3d.snglpnt program built with AmberTools, written by Tyler Luchko. It is the most expensive, yet most statistical mechanically rigorous solvation model available in MMPBSA.py . See Chapter 7 for a more thorough description of options and theory. A list of references can be found there, too. One advantage of 3D-RISM is that an arbitrary solvent can be chosen; you just need to change the xvvfile specified on the command line (see 34.3.2 ). buffer (Default = 14 \u00c5) Minimum distance between solute and edge of solvation box. Specify this with grdspc below. Mutually exclusive with ng and solvbox. Set buffer < 0 if you wish to use ng and solvbox . closure (Default = \"kh\") The approximation to the closure relation. Allowed choices are kh (Kovalenko-Hirata), hnc (Hypernetted- chain), or psen (Partial Series Expansion of order-n) where \"n\" is a positive integer ( e.g. , \"pse3\"). Deprecated closureorder (Default = 1) The order at which the PSE-n closure is truncated if closure is specified as \"pse\" or \"psen\" (no integers). grdspc (Default = 0.5 \u00c5) Grid spacing of the solvation box. Specify this with buffer above. Mutually exclusive with ng and solvbox . ng Number of grid points to use in the x, y, and z directions. Used only if buffer < 0. Mutually exclusive with buffer and grdspc above, and paired with solvbox below. Warning No default, this must be set if buffer < 0. Define like \"ng=1000,1000,1000\" polardecomp (Default = 0) Decompose the solvation free energy into polar and non-polar contributions. Note that this will increase computation time by roughly 80%. 0: Don\u2019t decompose solvation free energy. 1: Decompose solvation free energy. rism_verbose (Default = 0) Level of output in temporary RISM output files. May be helpful for debugging or following convergence. 0: just print the final result 1: additionally prints the total number of iterations for each solution 2: additionally prints the residual for each iteration and details of the MDIIS solver solvbox Length of the solvation box in the x, y, and z dimensions. Used only if buffer < 0. Mutually exclusive with buffer and grdspc above, and paired with ng above. Warining No default, this must be set if buffer < 0. Define like \"solvbox=20,20,20\" solvcut (Default = buffer ) Cutoff used for solute-solvent interactions. The default is the value of buffer. Therefore, if you set buffer < 0 and specify ng and solvbox instead, you must set solvcut to a nonzero value, or the program will quit in error. thermo (Default = \"std\") Which thermodynamic equation you want to use to calculate solvation properties. Options are \"std\", \"gf\", or \"both\" (case-INsensitive). \"std\" uses the standard closure relation, \"gf\" uses the Gaussian Fluctuation approximation,and \"both\" will print out separate sections for both. . Note Note that all data are printed out for each RISM simulation, so no choice is any more computationally demanding than another. Also, you can change this option and use the -rewrite-output flag to obtain a different printout after-the-fact. tolerance (Default = 1e-5) Upper bound of the precision requirement used to determine convergence of the self-consistent solution. This has a strong effect on the cost of 3D-RISM calculations. Sample input files \u00b6 Tip You can refer to the examples to understand the input file in a practical way.

The chain ID is assigned according to two criteria: terminal amino acids and residue numbering . If both criteria or residue numbering changes are present, we assign a new chain ID. If there are terminal amino acids but the numbering of the residue continues, we do not change the ID of the chain. \u21a9 \u21a9 These variables will choose a subset of the frames chosen from the variables in the &general namelist.

The input file is designed to be as syntactically similar to other programs in Amber as possible. The input file has the same namelist structure as both sander and pmemd. The allowed namelists are &general , &gb , &pb , &rism , &alanine_scanning , &nmode , and &decomp . The input variables recognized in each namelist are described below, but those in &general are typically variables that apply to all aspects of the calculation or parameters required for build amber topologies from GROMACS files. The &gb namelist is unique to Generalized Born calculations, &pb is unique to Poisson Boltzmann calculations, &rism is unique to 3D-RISM calculations, &alanine_scanning is unique to alanine scanning calculations, &nmode is unique to the normal mode calculations used to approximate vibrational entropies, and &decomp is unique to the decomposition scheme. All of the input variables are described below according to their respective namelists. Integers and floating point variables should be typed as-is while strings should be put in either single- or double-quotes. All variables should be set with variable = value and separated by commas.

It is ignored when defining a reference structure (recommended) . If assign_chainID = 1 , gmx_MMPBSA check if the structure has no chains ID and it is assigned according to the structure 1 . If assign_chainID = 2 , gmx_MMPBSA assign the chains ID, exist or not, according to the structure 1 (can generate inconsistencies). If a *.gro file was used for complex structure ( -cs flag) and not reference structure was provided, gmx_MMPBSA assume assign_chainID = 1 . New in v1.2.0 debug_printlevel gmx_MMPBSA prints errors by raising exceptions, and not catching fatal errors. If debug_printlevel is set to 0, then detailed tracebacks (effectively the call stack showing exactly where in the program the error occurred) is suppressed, so only the error message is printed. If debug_printlevel is set to 1 or higher, all tracebacks are printed, which aids in debugging of issues. (Default = 0) (Advanced Option) Changed in v1.2.0: Now gmx_MMPBSA shows the command-line used to build AMBER topologies when debug_printlevel = 1 or higher startframe (Default = 1) The frame from which to begin extracting snapshots from the full, concatenated trajectory comprised of every trajectory file placed on the command-line.

For example, an interval of 2 will pull every 2 nd frame beginning at startframe and ending less than or equal to endframe. netcdf (Default = 0) Specifies whether or not to use NetCDF trajectories internally rather than writing temporary ASCII trajectory files. For very large trajectories, this could offer significant speedups, and requires less temporary space. However, this option is incompatible with alanine scanning. 0: Do NOT use temporary NetCDF trajectories 1: Use temporary NetCDF trajectories overwrite_data (Default = 0) Defines whether the gmx_MMPBSA data will be overwritten. gmx_MMPBSA detects if the gmxMMPBSA data files exist before copying them. This option allows the user to control the copy process and prevents the system from being overloaded by copying files unnecessarily. 0: don't 1: overwrite gxmMMPBSA data if exist Tip We recommend activating this option with each new release because there may be changes and/or corrections in the gmxMMPBSA data files.

Free energy differences are calculated by combining the so-called gas phase energy contributions (MM term) that are independent of the chosen solvent model as well as solvation free energy components (both polar and non-polar) calculated from an implicit solvent model combination (PBSA or GBSA) for each species. Entropy contributions to the total free energy may be added as a further refinement. The gas phase free energy contributions are calculated by sander or mmpbsa_py_energy within the AmberTools package according to the force field used in the MD simulation. The solvation free energy contributions may be further decomposed into a polar and non-polar contributions. The polar portion is calculated using the Poisson Boltzmann (PB) equation, the Generalized Born method, or the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM). The PB equation is solved numerically by either the pbsa program included with AmberTools or by the Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver (APBS) program (for more information, see http://www.poissonboltzmann.org ). The non-polar contribution is approximated by the LCPO method implemented within sander or the molsurf method as implemented in cpptraj. The entropy calculations can be done in either a HCT Generalized Born solvation model or in the gas phase using a mmpbsa_py_nabnmode program written in the nab programming language, or via the quasi-harmonic approximation in ptraj as in the original MMPBSA.py . In this new module, entropy term (\u2212T\u0394S) can be also estimated using the so-called Interaction Entropy method, which is theoretically rigorous, computationally efficient, and numerically reliable for calculating entropic contribution to free energy in protein\u2013ligand binding and other interaction processes. Usually, the Single Trajectory (ST) approximation is employed when performing MM/PB(GB)SA calculations. This approximation assumes that the configurational space explored by the systems are very similar between the bound and unbound states, so every snapshot for each species ( i.e. complex, receptor, and ligand) is extracted from the same trajectory file. This approximation improves binding free energies convergence and also reduces the computing time. However, it only should be applied when the molecules in the unbound state present a similar behavior to that of the bound state. On the other hand, in the so-called Multiple Trajectory (MT) approximation, the snapshots for each one of the species ( i.e. complex, receptor, and ligand) are extracted from their own trajectory file. This approximation, theoretically more rigorous though, leads to higher standard deviation of the binding free energies.

Usually, the Single Trajectory (ST) approximation is employed when performing MM/PB(GB)SA calculations. This approximation assumes that the configurational space explored by the systems are very similar between the bound and unbound states, so every snapshot for each species ( i.e. complex, receptor, and ligand) is extracted from the same trajectory file. This approximation improves binding free energies convergence and also reduces the computing time. However, it only should be applied when the molecules in the unbound state present a similar behavior to that of the bound state. On the other hand, in the so-called Multiple Trajectory (MT) approximation, the snapshots for each one of the species ( i.e. complex, receptor, and ligand) are extracted from their own trajectory file. This approximation, theoretically more rigorous though, leads to higher standard deviation of the binding free energies.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#literature","text":"Further information can be found in Amber manual : MMPBSA.py The Generalized Born/Surface Area Model PBSA Reference Interaction Site Model Generalized Born (GB) for QM/MM calculations and the foundational papers: Srinivasan J. et al., 1998 Kollman P.

It will show a copy of the input file as well as the names of all files that were used in the calculation (topology files and coordinate file(s)). If the masks were not specified, it prints its best guess so that you can verify its accuracy, along with the residue name of the ligand (if it is only a single residue). The energy and entropy contributions are broken up into their components as they are in sander and nmode or ptraj . The contributions are further broken into G gas and G solv . The polar and non-polar contributions are EGB (or EPB ) and ESURF (or ECAVITY / ENPOLAR ), respectively for GB (or PB ) calculations. By default, bonded terms are not printed for any one-trajectory simulation. They are computed, and their differences calculated, however. They are not shown (nor included in the total) unless specifically asked for because they should cancel completely. A single trajectory does not produce any differences between bond lengths, angles, or dihedrals between the complex and receptor/ligand structures. Thus, when subtracted they cancel completely. This includes the BOND , ANGLE , DIHED , and 1-4 interactions . If inconsistencies are found, these values are displayed and inconsistency warnings are printed. When this occurs the results are generally useless. Of course this does not hold for the multiple trajectory protocol, and so all energy components are printed in this case. Finally, all warnings generated during the calculation that do not result in fatal errors are printed after calculation details but before any results.

If gmx_MMPBSA does not finish successfully, several of these files may be helpful in diagnosing the problem. For that reason, every temporary file is described below.

In addition, its GUI is very basic, as it is generally not widely used. gmx_MMPBSA_ana uses the latest PyQt5 version which requires updated graphics libraries.

Note Most of the errors noted here are the result of inconsistent input files. Please read the documentation and make sure your files are consistent. Inconsistent energy I get this error: ValueError: could not convert string to float: '*************' This error has two possible causes The structure defined in -cs , -ps , or -ls options is inconsistent, or the trajectory has not been fitted (remove PBC) properly. This is the most common error. Many times it is because the system under study is longer than some edges of the box. Solution: Check for structure consistency Visualize the structure contained in the structure input file given in the -cs , -rs , or -ls options and make sure it is consistent (as shown in Fig 1, right panel). On the other hand, if the structure is \"broken\" (as shown in Fig 1, left panel) this will generate inconsistent results.

You are trying to calculate the energetic contribution of a very large group. Technically, the energy value should not exceed 7 digits, so if you get a value higher than this, this error will occur. Although gmx_MMPBSA can handle very large systems as described in example Ribosomal50S_Mycalamide_A , it cannot determine certain energetic terms. This is a limitation of Sander when writing the output file. Note The error could be solved by recompiling Sander with some modifications in the output function. However, this is not recommended since the error can be large. Another possible solution could be modifying the parameters of the calculation (solvent model, internal dielectric constant) or just performing the calculation for a part of the system (sub-system). NMODE calculation finish in error The only error reported is probably related to RAM saturation.
