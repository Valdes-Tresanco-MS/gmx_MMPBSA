## gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.5 is out ðŸ˜€!

Check [changelog](changelog.md##gmx_mmpbsa-v152-03232022) to see what's new in gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.5.

## [Help needed for gmx_MMPBSA! To the content creators out there...](#colaboration)

gmx_MMPBSA is a new tool based on AMBER's MMPBSA.py aiming to perform end-state free energy calculations with GROMACS 
files. **_It works with all GROMACS versions along with AmberTools20, 21 or 22 and brings improvements in 
compatibility, versatility, analyses, and parallelization compared to existing programs (see [here](versus.md) for a 
detailed comparison)_**

!!! note "There is always more..."
    You can check [`gmx_MMPBSA` in a nutshell page](summary.md) for a more detailed overview of the types of calculations 
    supported in gmx_MMPBSA. Also check our [example page](examples/README.md) to see a detailed list of all the 
    examples available

In the current version, gmx_MMPBSA supports a number of different systems including but not limited to:

* [Protein-protein][12]
* [Protein-ligand][13]
* [Protein-DNA][14]
* [Metalloprotein-peptide][15]
* [Protein-glycan][16]
* [Membrane proteins][17]
* Multicomponent systems (_e.g._, [Protein-DNA-RNA-Ions-Ligand][18])

!!! note "Support for Amber, OPLS and CHARMM force fields"
    In the current version, gmx_MMPBSA supports Amber, OPLS and CHARMM force fields. Any system built for GROMACS with 
    either [pdb2gmx](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-pdb2gmx.html) or 
    [CHARMM-GUI](https://www.charmm-gui.org/) is supported in gmx_MMPBSA. Likewise, any system built for NAMD and 
    potentially any other software that uses *.psf - *.dcd files can be processed in gmx_MMPBSA ðŸ˜€. Check our 
    [example page](examples/README.md) to see a detailed list of all the examples available.

The following video shows how a typical binding free energy calculation with GB model and Interaction entropy method 
is performed in gmx_MMPBSA.

## **`gmx_MMPBSA` a quick overview**
`gmx_MMPBSA` is a python module that contains 3 applications: 

* [gmx_MMPBSA](howworks.md) is the fundamental application and carries out the calculations mentioned above
* [gmx_MMPBSA_ana](analyzer.md) provides an intuitive way to analyze the data from gmx_MMPBSA calculations and save 
  high-quality pictures
* [gmx_MMPBSA_test](examples/gmx_MMPBSA_test.md#gmx_mmpbsa_test-command-line) is a tool designed to test if the installation 
  was 
  successful by running one or more available [examples](examples/README.md) in gmx_MMPBSA.
  
!!! note "Easy to run"
    gmx_MMPBSA can run in parallel and requires just few things in order to perform any kind of calculation. That is:

    * an input parameters file (`*.in`, contains all the specifications regarding the type of calculation that is going 
    to be performed)
    * a MD Structure+mass(db) file (`*.tpr`, `*.pdb`)
    * an index file (`*.ndx`)
    * receptor and ligand groups (group numbers in the index file)
    * a trajectory file (`*.xtc`, `*.pdb`, `*.trr`)
    * In certain occasions, defining a topology file (`*.top`) may be required.

    Once the calculation is done, you can analyze the results in [gmx_MMPBSA_ana](analyzer.md)

    You can check [How gmx_MMPBSA works page](howworks.md) to get more details. Also check our 
    [example page](examples/README.md) to see how gmx_MMPBSA works with real examples

## **Colaboration**

gmx_MMPBSA is rapidly becoming one of the main programs to perform end-point free energy calculations out there 
(~27.5k downloads so far). We are currently focused on optimizing the program, supporting new types of calculations, 
force fields, etc. However, the video tutorials are not that great.

That being said, **and here is where we need help**, we will appreciate any collaboration in making video tutorials for 
the documentation. The video tutorial will be included as a link to YouTube in gmx_MMPBSA documentation with full 
acknowledgment of the person who created the video tutorial. It will be also acknowledged as a contributor of 
gmx_MMPBSA... ðŸ˜ƒ

Feel free to contact us through our google group (https://groups.google.com/g/gmx_mmpbsa) for more details...
