!!! danger "CHARMM and MM(PB/GB)SA"
    PB model is recommended when working with CHARMMff files. Nevertheless, the combination of PB/GB models with radii 
    optimized for amber atom types (_i.e._ bondi, mbondi, mbondi2, mbondi3) and CHARMM force field hasn't been tested 
    extensively. Please, check this [thread][1] for more information and proceed with caution.

    **:material-new-box:{:.heart } in gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.x series!!!**

    In gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.0 we have added a new PB radii set named _charmm_radii_. **This radii set should be used only 
    with systems prepared with CHARMM force fields**. The atomic radii set for Poisson-Boltzmann calculations has been 
    derived from average solvent electrostatic charge distribution with explicit solvent. The accuracy has been tested 
    with free energy perturbation with explicit solvent [ref.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp970736r). Most of 
    the values were taken from a _*radii.str_ file used in PBEQ Solver 
    in [charmm-gui](https://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/pbeqsolver).

# Protein-ligand binding free energy calculations (Single Trajectory method) with CHARMMff files

!!! info
    This example can be found in the [docs/examples/Protein_ligand_CHARMMff][6] directory in the repository folder. If you didn't 
    use gmx_MMPBSA_test before, use [downgit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download the specific folder from 
    gmx_MMPBSA GitHub repository.

## Requirements

In this case, `gmx_MMPBSA` requires:

| Input File required            |                             Required                              |          Type           | Description                                                                                                      |

:octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req } -> Must be defined -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_optrec } -> 
Optional, but recommended -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_opt } -> Optional

_See a detailed list of all the flags in gmx_MMPBSA command line [here][2]_

## Command-line
That being said, once you are in the folder containing all files, the command-line will be as follows:

=== "Serial"

        gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.xtc -cp topol.top -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

=== "With MPI"

        mpirun -np 2 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.xtc -cp topol.top -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

=== "gmx_MMPBSA_test"

        gmx_MMPBSA_test -t 10

where the `mmpbsa.in` input file, is a text file containing the following lines:

``` yaml linenums="1" title="Sample input file for PB calculation"
Sample input file for PB calculation
This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Althought,
we tried to used the input files as recommended in the Amber manual,
some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations
in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free to change the parameters 
according to what is better for your system.

&general
sys_name="Prot-Lig-CHARMM",
startframe=1,
endframe=4,
# In gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.0 we have added a new PB radii set named charmm_radii. 
# This radii set should be used only with systems prepared with CHARMM force fields. 
# Uncomment the line below to use charmm_radii set
#PBRadii=7,
/
&pb
# radiopt=0 is recommended which means using radii from the prmtop file for both the PB calculation and for the NP
# calculation
istrng=0.15, fillratio=4.0, radiopt=0
/
```

!!! warning "Remember"
    `radiopt = 0` is recommended which means using radii from the `prmtop` file

_See a detailed list of all the options in `gmx_MMPBSA` input file [here][3] as well as several [examples][4]_

## Considerations
In this case, a single trajectory (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand structures and 
trajectories will be obtained from that of the complex. To do so, an MD Structure+mass(db) file (`com.tpr`), an 
index file (`index.ndx`), a trajectory file (`com_traj.xtc`), and both the receptor and ligand group numbers in the 
index file (`1 13`) are needed. The `mmpbsa.in` input file will contain all the parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA 
calculation. A topology file is also needed (mandatory) in this case to generate the topology files in amber format 
with all the terms for CHARMM force field.

A plain text output file with all the statistics (default: `FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat`) and a CSV-format 
output file containing all energy terms for every frame in every calculation will be saved. The file name in 
'-eo' flag will be forced to end in [.csv] (`FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv` in this case). This file is only written when 
specified on the command-line.

!!! note
    Once the calculation is done, the results can be analyzed in `gmx_MMPBSA_ana` (if `-nogui` flag was not used in the command-line). 
    Please, check the [gmx_MMPBSA_ana][5] section for more information
