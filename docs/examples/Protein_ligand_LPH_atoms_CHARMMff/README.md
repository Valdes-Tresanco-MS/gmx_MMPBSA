!!! danger "CHARMM and MM(PB/GB)SA"
    PB model is recommended when working with CHARMMff files. Nevertheless, the combination of PB/GB models with radii 
    optimized for amber atom types (_i.e._ bondi, mbondi, mbondi2, mbondi3) and CHARMM force field hasn't been tested 
    extensively. Please, check this [thread][1] for more information and proceed with caution.

    **:material-new-box:{:.heart } in gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.x series!!!**

    In gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.0 we have added a new PB radii set named _charmm_radii_. **This radii set should be used only 
    with systems prepared with CHARMM force fields**. The atomic radii set for Poisson-Boltzmann calculations has been 
    derived from average solvent electrostatic charge distribution with explicit solvent. The accuracy has been tested 
    with free energy perturbation with explicit solvent [ref.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp970736r). Most of 
    the values were taken from a _*radii.str_ file used in PBEQ Solver 
    in [charmm-gui](https://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/pbeqsolver).

# Protein-ligand with LPH atoms BFE calculations (Single Trajectory method) -- CHARMMff files

!!! info

    This example can be found in the [examples/Protein_ligand_LPH_atoms_CHARMMff][6] directory in the repository
    folder

    LPH is a positively charged virtual particle attached to halogen atoms. This strategy aims to get a better 
    representation of the halogen bond which is a highly directional, non-covalent interaction between a halogen atom 
    and another electronegative atom (See [here][8] for more info). Unfortunately, including these particles in the 
    topology will cause gmx_MMPBSA to end in an error. However, there is a way to generate the files without these 
    particles and get gmx_MMPBSA up and running.

    
!!! danger "Keep in mind"

    As the LPH particle is not considered during the calculations in gmx_MMPBSA, take the results with a grain of 
    salt, especially when working with systems where the halogen bond is determinant for the binding.

    **:material-new-box:{:.heart } in gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.x series!!!**

    We have included standard radii for halogens in _charmm_radii_ set:

    * Cl: 1.86
    * Br: 1.98
    * I: 2.24

    This radii set should be used with the following PBSA setup:

    ```

## Requirements

In this case, `gmx_MMPBSA` requires:

| Input File required            | Required |           Type             | Description |
|:-------------------------------|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Optional, but recommended -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_opt } -> Optional

_See a detailed list of all the flags in gmx_MMPBSA command line [here][2]_

In order to generate the corresponding files (The MD Structure+mass(db), index, trajectory and the topology files) 
without the LPH particles, it's necessary to run a few commands. Bear with me!

Let's generate the index file first:

!!! important
    The main idea here is to generate a receptor group, a 
    ligand group without the LPH particles and a complex group containing both the receptor and the ligand without 
    the LPH particles. In general, index files generated with GROMACS directly will contain more detailed information 
    (_i.e._, receptor and ligand separated)

```

 18 Protein_lig         :  5610 atoms
```

!!! note
    Note that the number of atoms in the generated complex is 5610 because it doesn't include the LPH particles.

Let's generate the MD Structure+mass(db) file:

    echo 18 | gmx trjconv -s com.tpr -f traj_fit.xtc -dump 0 -o str_noLP.pdb -n index_mod_gromacs.ndx

Open `str_noLP.pdb` in your favorite visualizer and see it doesn't contain the LPH particles. Now, let's generate 
the trajectory with no LPH particles:

    echo 18 | gmx trjconv -s com.tpr -f traj_fit.xtc -o com_traj.xtc -n index_mod_gromacs.ndx

Finally, let's edit the topology file. Go inside the toppar folder and open the `HETA.itp` file. As you will see, we
deleted all the information related with LPH particles (atom numbers 31, and 32 respectively). In this case, we
deleted the information for LPH particles in `atoms` (lines 47, 48) and `pairs` (lines 124, 132, 150, 153, 154, 157, 
158, 159). Besides, delete the whole `[ virtual_sites3 ]` (lines 296-299) and `[ exclusions ]` (lines 301-318) 
fields. The original .itp (`HETA_original_with_LPH_info.itp`) is included for comparison purposes.


## Command-line
That being said, once you are in the folder containing all files, the command-line will be as follows:

=== "Serial"

        gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs str_noLP.pdb -ci index_mod_gromacs.ndx -cg 1 17 -ct com_traj.xtc -cp topol.top -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

=== "With MPI"

        mpirun -np 2 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs str_noLP.pdb -ci index_mod_gromacs.ndx -cg 1 17 -ct com_traj.xtc -cp topol.top -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

where the `mmpbsa.in` input file, is a text file containing the following lines:

``` yaml linenums="1" title="Sample input file for PB calculation"
Sample input file for PB calculation
This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Althought,
we tried to used the input files as recommended in the Amber manual,
some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations
in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free to change the parameters 
according to what is better for your system.

&general
sys_name="Prot-Lig-ST",
startframe=5,
endframe=9,
solvated_trajectory=0,
# In gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.0 we have added a new PB radii set named charmm_radii. 
# This radii set should be used only with systems prepared with CHARMM force fields. 
# Uncomment the line below to use charmm_radii set
#PBRadii=7,
/
&pb
# radiopt=0 is recommended which means using radii from the prmtop file
# for both the PB calculation and for the NP calculation

istrng=0.15, fillratio=4, radiopt=0, inp=1,
/
```

!!! warning "Remember"
    `radiopt = 0` is recommended which means using radii from the `prmtop` file

_See a detailed list of all the options in `gmx_MMPBSA` input file [here][3] as well as several [examples][4]_

## Considerations
In this case, a single trajectory (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand structures and 
trajectories will be obtained from that of the complex. To do so, an MD Structure+mass(db) file (`str_noLP.pdb`), an 
index file (`index_mod_gromacs.ndx`), a trajectory file (`com_traj.xtc`), and both the receptor and ligand group 
numbers in the index file (`1 17`) are needed. The `mmpbsa.in` input file will contain all the parameters needed for 
the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation. A topology file is also needed (mandatory) in this case to generate the topology files 
in amber format with all the terms for CHARMM force field.

A plain text output file with all the statistics (default: `FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat`) and a CSV-format 
output file containing all energy terms for every frame in every calculation will be saved. The file name in 
'-eo' flag will be forced to end in [.csv] (`FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv` in this case). This file is only written when 
specified on the command-line.

!!! note
    Once the calculation is done, the results can be analyzed in `gmx_MMPBSA_ana` (if `-nogui` flag was not used in the command-line).
