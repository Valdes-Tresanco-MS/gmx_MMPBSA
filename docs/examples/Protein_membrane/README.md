# MMPBSA with membrane proteins

!!! info
    This example can be found in the [docs/examples/Protein_membrane][6] directory in the repository folder. If you didn't 
    use gmx_MMPBSA_test before, use [downgit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download the specific folder from 
    gmx_MMPBSA GitHub repository.

## Requirements
!!! danger
    The ligand mol2 file must be the Antechamber output.

In this case, `gmx_MMPBSA` requires:

!!! tip "Remember"
    When a topology file is defined, the ligand mol2 file is not needed. The ligand mol2 file only required when  
    `gmx_MMPBSA` build the amber topology from a structure  
_See a detailed list of all the flags in gmx_MMPBSA command line [here][1]_

## Command-line
That being said, once you are in the folder containing all files, the command-line will be as follows:

=== "Serial"

        gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.pdb -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.pdb -lm ligand.mol2 -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

=== "With MPI"

        mpirun -np 2 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.pdb -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.pdb -lm ligand.mol2 -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

=== "gmx_MMPBSA_test"

        gmx_MMPBSA_test -t 6

where the `mmpbsa.in` input file, is a text file containing the following lines:

``` yaml linenums="1" title="Sample input file for MMPBSA with membrane proteins"
Sample input file for MMPBSA with membrane proteins
This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Althought,
we tried to used the input files as recommended in the Amber manual,
some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations
in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free to change the parameters 
according to what is better for your system.

&general
sys_name="Prot-Memb",
startframe=1,
endframe=4,

&pb
memopt=1, emem=7.0, indi=4.0,
mctrdz=-10.383, mthick=36.086, poretype=1,

eneopt=1, cutfd=7.0, cutnb=99.0,

/
```

!!! info "Keep in mind"
    See a detailed list of all the options in `gmx_MMPBSA` input file [here][2] as well as several [examples][3]. 
    These examples are meant only to show that gmx_MMPBSA works. It is recommended to go over these variables, even 
    the ones that are not included in this input file but are available for the calculation that it's performed and
    see the values they can take (check the [input file section](../../input_file.md)). This will allow you to 
    tackle a number of potential problems or simply use fancier approximations in your calculations.

## Considerations
In this case, a single trajectory (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand structures and
trajectories will be obtained from that of the complex. To do so, an MD Structure+mass(db) file (`com.pdb`), an 
index file (`index.ndx`), a trajectory file (`com_traj.pdb`), and both the receptor and ligand group numbers in the 
index file (`1 13`) are needed. A ligand .mol2 file is also needed for generating the ligand topology. The `mmpbsa.
in` input file will contain all the parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation. Of note, special parameters 
for MMPBSA with membrane proteins have been included.

!!! note "Comments on parameters for implicit membranes"
    The inclusion of an implicit membrane region in implicit solvation calculations is enabled by setting 
    `memopt` to 1 (default value is 0, for off). The membrane will extend the solute dielectric region to include a 
    slab-like planar region of uniform dielectric constant running parallel to the xy plane. The dielectric constant 
    can be controlled using `emem`. We set the membrane interior dielectric constant to a value of 7.0 in this example. 
    The value of `emem` should always be set to a value greater than or equal to `indi` (solute dielectric constant, 
    4 in this example) and less than `exdi` (solvent dielectric constant, 80.0 default).

    [<img src="../../assets/prot_memb.png" height="200" width="258" align="right"/>]()

    The thickness is controlled by the `mthick` option (36.086 Å in this case). The center of the membrane region is 
    controlled with `mctrdz` and in this case the membrane region will be centered at -10.383 Å down of the center 
    of the protein. If calculations are performed on a protein with a solvent-filled channel region, this 
    region would be identified automatically by setting `poretype=1`.
    
    When using the implicit membrane model, the default `sasopt=0`, _i.e._ the classical solvent excluded
    surface, is recommended due to its better numerical behavior. When running with the default options, the program 
    will compute solvent excluded surfaces both with the water probe (`prbrad=1.40` by default) and the membrane probe
    (`mprob=2.70` by default). This setting was found to be consistent with the explicit solvent MD simulations. 

    It is also suggested that periodic boundary conditions be used to avoid unphysical edge effects. This is supported 
    in all linear solvers. In the following, Geometric multigrid is chosen (`solvopt=2`) with `ipb=1` and `bcopt=10`.
    The `linit=1000` should work fine, but take into account that working with linear and periodic boundary conditions 
    could require more iterations.

    In addition, `eneopt` needs to be set to 1 because the charge-view method (`eneopt = 2`) is not supported for 
    this application. When `eneopt=1`, the total electrostatic energy and forces will be 
    computed with the particle-particle particle-mesh (P3M) procedure outlined in Lu and Luo.[8] In doing so, 
    energy term `EPB` in the output file is set to zero, while `EEL` term includes both the reaction field 
    energy (`EPB`) and the Coulombic energy (`EEL`). The van der Waals energy is computed along with the 
    particle-particle portion of the Coulombic energy. This option requires a nonzero CUTNB (in this case, `cutnb=8.0`).
    It's noteworthy mentioning that `ΔGGAS` and `ΔGSOLV` as reported are no longer 
    properly decomposed. Since `EPB` and `EEL` are combined into the "gas phase" term, the gas and solvation terms 
    can't be separated. Nevertheless, the total ΔTOTAL should be perfectly fine, since everything is sum up together 
    in the end.

    !!! Danger
        Note that a smaller `fillratio=1.25` is used compared to the defult one (4.0). The use of a periodic boundary 
        also allowed a somewhat small fill ratio (_i.e._, the ratio of the finite-difference box dimension over the 
        solute dimension) of 1.25 to be used in these 
        calculations ([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00382)). Be cautious when changing this 
        parameter as its increase may lead to a considerable RAM usage (specially when running the program in parralel). 
        Just for your information, using the default `fillratio=4.0` in this relatively small system requieres as much 
        as ~30GB per thread :exploding_head: and more time to finish the calculation.

A plain text output file with all the statistics (default: `FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat`) and a CSV-format 
output file containing all energy terms for every frame in every calculation will be saved. The file name in 
'-eo' flag will be forced to end in [.csv] (`FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv` in this case). This file is only written when 
specified on the command-line.


!!! note
    Once the calculation is done, the results can be analyzed in `gmx_MMPBSA_ana` (if `-nogui` flag was not used in the command-line).
