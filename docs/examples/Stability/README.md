# Stability calculations

!!! info
    This example can be found in the [docs/examples/Stability/][6] directory in the repository folder. If you didn't 
    use gmx_MMPBSA_test before, use [downgit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download the specific folder from 
    gmx_MMPBSA GitHub repository.

## Requirements

In this case, `gmx_MMPBSA` requires:


| Input File required            | Required |           Type             | Description |
|:-------------------------------|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input parameters file          | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |           `in`          | Input file containing all the specifications regarding the type of calculation that is going to be performed |
| The MD Structure+mass(db) file | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |    `tpr` `pdb`    | Structure file containing the system coordinates |
| An index file                  | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |          `ndx`    | File containing the receptor and ligand in separated groups |
| Receptor and ligand group      | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |        `integers`       | Group numbers in the index files |
| A trajectory file              | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } | `xtc` `pdb` `trr` | Final GROMACS MD trajectory, fitted and with no pbc. |
| A topology file (not included) | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_opt .scale_icon_medium }    |           `top`         | GROMACS topology file (The `* .itp` files defined in the topology must be in the same folder |
| A Reference Structure file     | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_optrec .scale_icon_medium } |           `pdb`         | Complex reference structure file (without hydrogens) with the desired assignment of chain ID and residue numbers |
              
:octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req } -> Must be defined -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_optrec } -> 
Optional, but recommended -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_opt } -> Optional

_See a detailed list of all the flags in gmx_MMPBSA command line [here][1]_

## Command-line
That being said, once you are in the folder containing all files, the command-line will be as follows:

=== "Serial"

        gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -s -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 19 20 -ct com_traj.xtc -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

=== "With MPI"

        mpirun -np 2 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 19 20 -ct com_traj.xtc -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

=== "gmx_MMPBSA_test"

        gmx_MMPBSA_test -t 13

where the `mmpbsa.in` input file, is a text file containing the following lines:

``` yaml linenums="1" title="Sample input file for GB calculation"
Sample input file for GB calculation
This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Althought,
we tried to used the input files as recommended in the Amber manual,
some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations
in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free to change the parameters 
according to what is better for your system.

&general
sys_name="Stability",
startframe=5,
endframe=14,
forcefields="oldff/leaprc.ff99SB",
/
&gb
igb=2, saltcon=0.150,
/
```

!!! info "Keep in mind"
    See a detailed list of all the options in `gmx_MMPBSA` input file [here][2] as well as several [examples][3]. 
    These examples are meant only to show that gmx_MMPBSA works. It is recommended to go over these variables, even 
    the ones that are not included in this input file but are available for the calculation that it's performed and
    see the values they can take (check the [input file section](../../input_file.md)). This will allow you to 
    tackle a number of potential problems or simply use fancier approximations in your calculations.

  
## Considerations
In this case, a single trajectory (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand (in this case, the 
ligand is also another protein) amber format topologies and trajectories will be obtained from that of the complex. To 
do so, an MD Structure+mass(db) file (`com.tpr`), an index file (`index.ndx`), a trajectory file (`com_traj.xtc`), and 
both the receptor and ligand group numbers in the index file (`19 20`) are needed. The `mmpbsa.in` input file will 
contain all the parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation. In this case, 10 frames 
are going to be used when performing the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation with the igb2 (GB-OBC1) model and a salt 
concentration = 0.15M.

"Stability" calculation will be performed, and you will get statistics based on only a single system (complex). Any 
additional receptor or ligand information given will be ignored.

A plain text output file with all the statistics (default: `FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat`) and a CSV-format 
output file containing all energy terms for every frame in every calculation will be saved. The file name in 
'-eo' flag will be forced to end in [.csv] (`FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv` in this case). This file is only written when 
specified on the command-line.

!!! note
    Once the calculation is done, the results can be analyzed in `gmx_MMPBSA_ana` (if `-nogui` flag was not used in the command-line).
