Sample input file for PB calculation
This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Although, we tried to use the input files as recommended
in the Amber manual, some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free to change the
parameters according to what is better for your system.

#radiopt=0 is recommended which means using radii from the prmtop file for both the PB calculation and for the NP calculation
