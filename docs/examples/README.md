Here you can find a representation of almost all the types of calculations and analyses that you can perform 
with `gmx_MMPBSA`. Although each example focuses on specific cases, you can use `gmx_MMPBSA` on systems that combine 
a number of different components (_i.e._ metalloprotein-ligand complex, Protein-DNA-ligand, etc.). In addition, 
several types of calculations (_e.g._ GB, Alanine scanning and Per-residue decomposition; PB, Interaction Entropy, 
and Per-wise decomposition) can be also performed in the same run for a specific system.

## Systems

This is a representation of the systems that can be processed and analyzed with gmx_MMPBSA. Our program has a robust 
method to process input structures. Even if your system is not represented here, still have a go, you won't 
be disappointed! ðŸ˜€

## CHARMMff support

This section focuses more on how to work with systems prepared with CHARMM force fields. We only show few examples 
for better clarity.

## Analysis

This section focuses on the analysis that can be performed with gmx_MMPBSA. Although each example focuses on specific 
cases, you can use gmx_MMPBSA to perform several types of calculations (_e.g._ GB, Alanine scanning and Per-residue 
decomposition; PB, Interaction Entropy, and Per-residue decomposition) in the same run for a specific system.

## Support for psf_dcd files

This section focuses on how to work with psf-dcd files. These files are used for several MD simulation 
programs such as NAMD, OpenMM or GENESIS. We plan to add more examples in the near future.
