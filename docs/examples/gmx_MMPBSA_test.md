                            the number of processors = number of frames.
    
    
    gmx_MMPBSA is an effort to implement the GB/PB and others calculations in GROMACS. 
    Based on MMPBSA.py (version 16.0) and AmberTools20

## Running gmx_MMPBSA_test
gmx_MMPBSA_test is designed to run a set of samples (all or minimal) or a specific example efficiently. 
Additionally, gmx_MMPBSA_test can run in parallel, decreasing the execution time gmx_MMPBSA_test will download the 
most recent version of the repository in the specified folder and will perform the calculations.
