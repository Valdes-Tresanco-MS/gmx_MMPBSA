# Protein-protein binding free energy calculations with NAMD files

!!! info
    This example can be found in the [docs/examples/NAMD/protein-protein][6] directory in the repository folder. If you 
    didn't use gmx_MMPBSA_test before, use [downgit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download the specific folder 
    from gmx_MMPBSA GitHub repository.

    In this example we are going to generate gmx_MMPBSA input files from NAMD's files. **It is strongly recommended to 
    check [how gmx_MMPBSA works][9] before attempting any sort of calculations.** See below the input files 
    required for running gmx_MMPBSA.

## Requirements

In this case, `gmx_MMPBSA` requires:

| Input File required            | Required |           Type             | Description |

| An index file                  | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |          `ndx`    | File containing the receptor and ligand in separated groups |
| Receptor and ligand group      | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |        `integers`       | Group numbers in the index files |

:octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req } -> Must be defined -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_optrec } -> 
Optional, but recommended -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_opt } -> Optional

    === "1- The input file `*.in`"

        The input file `*.in` is already included in the tutorial folder, although it can be easily generated using 
        [`--create_input` command][8]. The `*.in` input file, is a text file containing the following lines:

        ``` yaml linenums="1" title="Sample input file for GB calculation"
        Input file generated by gmx_MMPBSA (v1.5.0.3)
        Be careful with the variables you modify, some can have severe consequences on the results you obtain.

        _See a detailed list of all the options in `gmx_MMPBSA` input file [here][2] as well as several [examples][3]_

    === "2- The MD Structure+mass(db) and the trajectory files"

        We are going to use `cpptraj` program from Amber to process the *.psf and *.dcd files:

            Press enter after every command line
            
                cpptraj -p step3_input.psf
                >trajin traj.dcd
                >strip :POT,CLA,TIP3
                >trajout gromacs.pdb onlyframes 1
                >trajout traj.xtc
                >run
                >exit

        After executing these commands, there should be two new files in te folder, _i.e._ `gromacs.pdb` that is 
        going to be used as the MD Structure+mass(db) file, and `traj.xtc` that is going to be used as the 
        trajectory file.

    === "3- The topology file"

        We are going to use `ParmEd` to convert the *.psf file into a GROMACS topology file. To do so, use the 
        ParmEd script that is already included in the tutorial folder. 

            python script.py

        Take your time to analyze step by step the process of converting *.psf/*.crd files intoa  GROMACS topology 
        with ParmEd

        ``` python
        # import ParmEd module
        import parmed as pmd
        
        # load psf file
        psf = pmd.load_file('step3_input.psf')
        
        #load coordinate file
        psf.coordinates = pmd.load_file('step3_input.crd').coordinates
        
        # strip ions and water
        psf.strip(':POT, CLA, TIP3, LIT, SOD, RUB, CES, BAR')
        
        # load Charmm Parameter Set. Make sure to include all the necessary force filed files in this list
        params = pmd.charmm.CharmmParameterSet('toppar/par_all36_carb.prm',
                                               'toppar/par_all36_cgenff.prm',
                                               'toppar/par_all36_lipid.prm',
                                               'toppar/par_all36m_prot.prm',
                                               'toppar/par_all36_na.prm',
                                               'toppar/par_interface.prm',
                                               'toppar/toppar_water_ions.str')
        psf.load_parameters(params)
        
        # save GROMACS topology file
        psf.save('gromacs.top')
        ```

    === "4- The index file"

        The last file we need to generate is the index file containing the groups with the receptor and ligand atoms.
        To do so, just use `make_ndx` from GROMACS and the MD Structure+mass(db) that was generated previously.

            Press enter after every command line
            
                gmx make_ndx -f gromacs.pdb -o index.ndx
                >a 1-3220
                >a 3221-4124
                >q

        After this, there should be two new groups (10, 11) in teh index file that contains atoms from 1 to 3220 for 
        the receptor and atoms 3221 to 4124 for the ligand.

Once the gmx_MMPBSA files have been generated, the program can be run either in serial or in parallel:

=== "Serial"

        gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs gromacs.pdb -ct traj.xtc -ci index.ndx -cg 10 11 -cp gromacs.top

=== "With MPI"

        mpirun -np 2 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs gromacs.pdb -ct traj.xtc -ci index.ndx -cg 10 11 -cp gromacs.top

## Considerations
In this case, a single trajectory (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand structures and 
trajectories will be obtained from that of the complex. To do so, an MD Structure+mass(db) file (`gromacs.pdb`), an 
index file (`index.ndx`),
a trajectory file (`traj.xtc`), and both the receptor and ligand group numbers in the index file (`10 11`) are needed.
The `mmpbsa.in` input file will contain all the 
parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation. In this case, 11 frames 
are going to be used when performing the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation with the igb5 (GB-OBC2) model and a 
salt concentration = 0.15M.

!!! note
    Once the calculation is done, you can analyze the results in `gmx_MMPBSA_ana` (if you didn't define `-nogui`).
