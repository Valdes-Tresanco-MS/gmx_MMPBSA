Sample input file for QM/MMGBSA calculation
This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works.
Although, we tried to use the input files as recommended in the
Amber manual, some parameters have been changed to perform more
expensive calculations in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free
to change the parameters according to what is better for your system.

# Residues to be treated with QM can be selected using different approaches. Please, make sure to include at least
# one residue from both the receptor and ligand in the qm_residues mask when using 'ifqnt'. This requirement is
# automatically fulfilled when using the within keyword https://groups.google.com/g/gmx_mmpbsa/c/GNb4q4YGCH8
