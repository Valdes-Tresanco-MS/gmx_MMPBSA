Sample input file for entropy calculations
#This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Although, we tried to use the input files as recommended in the
#Amber manual, some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free to change the parameters
#according to what is better for your system.

#note that nmode will use only a fraction of the no. of frames selected in &general variable (21-5/1=16 in this case). This way, nmode will only process 2 frames (15th and 16th frames)
#note also that some parameters have been change to perform the calculation faster (maxcyc=5, drms=100). The typical values for these parameters are (maxcyc=50000, drms=0.001)
